This plugin is mostly a fork from [mlir-syntax-highlight](https://github.com/Lewuathe/obsidian-mlir-syntax-highlight) which is a fork from [cm-editor-syntax-highlight-obsidian
](https://github.com/deathau/cm-editor-syntax-highlight-obsidian) but only supporting the Nasm syntax highlighting for the simplicity.
